This is a message to those who still don't wear masks.

To those who still meet in groups of five or six.

To those who still, after a year-long pandemic, don't remember to cover their noses.

To those who refuse to take freely available tests.

To those who perpetuate conspiracy theories.

To those who routinely travel across national borders for luxury vacations.

To those who don't take, or don't want to take, the vaccine.

Here is my message:

***FUCK YOU.***

This isn't hyperbole. This isn't a joke. I don't care how well I know you, how close we are, how how safe you claim to be. I don't care who you are, where you are or how low-risk you are. I don't care about your "medical mask exemption", I don't care about your discomfort, I don't care about your acne. Because, if you fall into any one of those categories above, you are--and let me be very, very clear on this--*a piece of shit*.

Unlike you, I do care about others. I care about senior citizens, whose lives would be deeply threatened should they contract COVID-19. I care about people like my mother, some of whom take immunosuppressant drugs to manage chronic immune conditions. I care about those who, months after infection, still suffer from [long COVID](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-tragedy-of-the-post-covid-long-haulers-2020101521173), with mental and physical symptoms persisting despite the virus having been treated. I care about the people, and there are far too many of them, who will go through life with permanent organ damage because of the toll that this virus has taken on their body. You pain and frustrate me. How can you be so uncaring and unempathetic? How do you prioritise your own avoidance of mild discomfort over the very lives of others? Are you not ashamed?

And I don't only care about the people who can, and do, die from COVID-19. Surprisingly enough, I care about you, too. I care about you and me and my friends and my sister and my girlfriend and all those of this generation who are having their childhood and teenage years taken from them. But do not allow yourself to think for a moment that the solution to this problem is to reopen and thereby allow the health and lives of those at risk to be endangered further. The solution, in fact, is quite simple: to stop whining and wear the goddamn mask. Our generation deserves teenage years and a healthy economy, yes, but in what world is this goal unachievable without sacrificing innocent people? It's your own ignorance, stupidity and lack of empathy that inevitably leads to recurring cycles of lockdown. If you take but one piece of information from this post, let it be this: *this pandemic is your fault*. It's your refusal to follow rules, your lack of care for the basic right to life of others, your apathy and lack of understanding that are the reason for COVID-19's continued prevalence. Two weeks of everyone's life spent completely indoors would all but eliminate the virus and bring the pandemic to a halt. Two weeks spent watching Netflix and attending Zoom conferences would save countless lives, countless amounts of pain and suffering and death, not to mention everyone else being forced in and out of seemingly endless lockdowns. But you refuse. You refuse the smallest sacrifice made for the greatest good. 

Why?

Because you're a fucking snowflake.
