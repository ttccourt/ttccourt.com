**This is a real collection of genuine, non-satirical takes I've seen online. They are all genuinely awful and I do not agree with any of them. Browse at your own risk.*

- Exercising for any reason except health (i.e. to change your appearance) is fatphobic
- Not wanting to be fat is fatphobic
- The word 'obese' is a slur
- Able-bodied people should not use elevators for short journeys
- Anyone who identifies as antifa is actually part of a hierarchical organisation, even if they aren't aware of it
- Not liking the way a house looks is classist
