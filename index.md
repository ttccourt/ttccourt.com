Hi! I'm a tenth-grade IB student and leftist currently based in DÃ¼sseldorf. I do things with computers and cameras. Here are some things I've done:

-   [Pronounimizer](https://pronouns.ttccourt.com). Try out pronouns that work for you.
-   [Cyte](https://cyte.ttccourt.com). Simple, no-BS source citing in MLA.
-   [Geoshock](https://geoshock.ttccourt.com). A text-based fantasy RPG. Save the world, get the girl, eat the garlic bread.
-   [Notemarklet](/notemarklet). A free, simple, offline-capable bookmarklet for taking notes in your web browser.

My photography can be found on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ttccourt). For more projects, including my older stuff, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/ttccourt). 

If you want to get in touch, email `theo@ttccourt.com`, or tweet to [`@ttccourt`](https://twitter.com/ttccourt).
