I’m a tenth-grade International Baccalaureate student living in the state of NRW in Germany. I’m interested in pursuing a degree in Computer Science and a career in IT. I also take photos, play video games, build PCs and do programming. I speak English natively and I have intermediate-level German. I was born in New Zealand in 2005, but have experienced the benefits of an international upbringing, having since lived in the Netherlands, Australia, and now Germany for the past six years. I have experience in photography, information technology and as an event/theatre technician.
